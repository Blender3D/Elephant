# Elephant

Elephant is a chess engine written in Python. I value readability and organization over speed (for now), so the code should be as readable as can be and will probably perform horribly when compared to well-coded engines.

## Features

 - Queen, king, rook, bishop, knight and pawn moves/attacks.
 - Stalemate evaluation based on material and piece mobility.
 - Checkmate evaluation.
 - En passant.
 - Pawn promotion.

## Currently being implemented

 - Castling.
 - Board evaluation (it works, but only to `depth=1`).
 - UCI interface.
